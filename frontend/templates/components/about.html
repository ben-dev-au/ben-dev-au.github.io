                <p class="mt-3">
                <p>For the past 20 years, my passion for the wine industry has driven me to explore its many
                    facets,
                    from vineyard to cellar and beyond. This pursuit has been more than a job; it's been a
                    personal
                    investment of time, resources, and countless journeys to wine regions worldwide, including
                    extensive exploration across Australia. My love of motorcycling and photography has often
                    intersected with these travels, leading to many unforgettable rides through frequently
                    stunning
                    wine country.</p>

                <p>Throughout my career, I've consistently sought opportunities to leverage technology and
                    custom
                    systems to address inefficiencies and drive improvements within the wine industry. This
                    problem-solving mindset has been a constant, from driving and creating databases to digitise
                    and
                    more efficiently manage some of the world's largest wine cellars to building user interfaces
                    that cut stocktaking times by nearly a week every month; and through to building a custom
                    e-commerce platform (complete with 360° bottle images for label viewing—my favorite feature)
                    and
                    revitalising a struggling independent wine retail business. In this role, I led a complete
                    business overhaul, modernising operations and ultimately returning the business to
                    profitability
                    following a long period of losses.</p>

                <p>My career has also encompassed diverse experiences, from the excitement of working at
                    Glastonbury
                    Festival to the hands-on work of vintages at various wineries. I've honed my skills as a
                    Sommelier in renowned 2-3 Hat and World Top 50 restaurants, earning both national and
                    international accolades. While these experiences were invaluable, some of my fondest
                    memories
                    come from working in the lesser-known restaurants, often in the middle of nowhere, quietly
                    delivering authentic magic.</p>

                <p>This passion for building technology led me to pursue a formal education in software
                    engineering
                    at the University of South Australia in 2024. Since then, my goal has been to transition my
                    focus from using technology as a tool within the wine industry to building technology as my
                    core
                    profession and passion.</p>
